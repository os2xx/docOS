\frametitle{Week 07 Synchronization \& Deadlock:
Topics\footnote{Source: ACM IEEE CS Curricula}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Shared Memory and Critical Section
\item Consistency, and its role in programming language guarantees for data-race-free programs
\item Message passing: PtPo vs Multicast, Blocking vs non-blocking, buffering.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Week 07 Synchronization \& Deadlock:
Learning Outcomes\footnote{Source: ACM IEEE CS Curricula}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use mutual exclusion to avoid a given race condition. [Usage]
\item Give an example of an ordering of accesses among concurrent activities (e.g., program with a data race) that is not sequentially consistent. [Familiarity]
\item Use semaphores to block threads [Usage]
\end{itemize}
