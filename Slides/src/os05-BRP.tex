\frametitle{Week 05 Virtual Memory:
Learning Outcomes\footnote{Source: ACM IEEE CS Curricula}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain memory hierarchy and cost-performance trade-offs. [Familiarity]
\item Summarize the principles of virtual memory as applied to caching and paging. [Familiarity] 
\item Describe the reason for and use of cache memory (performance and proximity, different dimension of how caches complicate isolation and VM abstraction). [Familiarity] 
\item Defend the different ways of allocating memory to tasks, citing the relative merits of each. [Assessment] 
\item Evaluate the trade-offs in terms of memory size (main memory, cache memory, auxiliary memory) and processor speed. [Assessment] 
\item Discuss the concept of thrashing, both in terms of the reasons it occurs and the techniques used to recognize and manage the problem. [Familiarity] 
\end{itemize}
